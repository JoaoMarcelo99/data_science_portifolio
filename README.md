# João Marcelo
<sub>*Data Scientist Student*</sub>

I'm a Brazilian student that has an intrinsic need for knowledge and learn new stuff. I start developing an interest in AI, machine learning, deep learning, and other programming stuff. Now I consider working in something in that area. I believe that only when we start doing something meaningful, we start doing anything. 

I am currently in a physics with scheduled to end in 2021 in *Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ)*, one federal university in Brazil with great prestige.

**Background in:** C, C++, Python, R, Machine Learning, Calculus, Linear Algebra.
